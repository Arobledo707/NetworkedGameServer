# NetworkedGameServer

This is a project I am currently refactoring. It uses tcp to send/data to and from a client.  The server is set up to have players login with a username and password(the password is stored in plain text :().  The game itself is like a version of rock paper scissors but with armies.  I felt like I needed experience refacoring some of my code.
